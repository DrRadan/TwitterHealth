14. [Week7, Oct29- Nov5]__resample_confidence_interval.ipynb__: add resampling confidence interval
15. [Week8, Nov5-Nov11] __Run_Statistic.ipynb__: Applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to each LDA model and visulization.
16. [Week8, Nov5-Nov11] __day_of_week_change.ipynb__: How the frequency of tweet mentioning food and actitvity differs in terms of the 7 days of week


/pyhton script/: the code run on HPC
1. [Week 1,2 Sep17-Oct2] __process_raw_data.py__: the code used to convert original twitter data in json format to csv format for future analysis
2. [Week 3 Oct2-Oct8] __filter_en_text.py__: the code used to remove all the tweets that are not in english
3. [Week 3 Oct2-Oct8] __token_by_spark.py__: using spark to do tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
4. [Week 3 Oct2-Oct8] __token_by_whole_file.py__: read entire csv file (require a lot of memeory) and then do tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
5. [Week 3 Oct2-Oct8] __token_row_by_row.py__: read a csv file row by row, for each row do tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization (require less memeory)
6.[Week 4,5 Oct8-Oct29] __key_word_process.py__: read a csv file containing tweets and find whether the tweet mentions food or activity key words
7. [Week 4 Oct8-Oct15] __Run_LDA.py__: run LDA topic modeling with different configurations.
8. [Week7, Oct29- Nov5] __Run_LDAwithPlot.py__: Loading trained LDA model with different configurations and made plots for each model.

#  Twitter Word2Vec
<h3>Learn the distributed representation of Twitter text with word2vec. </h3>
To create environment, run: <br>
```conda create env -f environment.yml```
To get word embeddings of Twitter text, run <br>
```python get_embeddings.py```

# Elasticsearch
<h3>Information extraction over large quantities of twitter texts</h3>
Scripts under this directory is supposed to extract information from ~310 million twitter records. We use the python API of Elasticsearch to retrieve twitter texts by fuzzy keyword searching. Before running the scripts, make sure the following setups are done successfully: <br>
1. Download the [elasticsearch 5.3.0](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-5-3-0) and unzip:
```tar -xzvf elasticsearch-5.3.0.tar.gz```
2. Run the elasticsearch instance in background:
```cd <..>/elasticsearch-5.3.0```
```nohup bash bin/elasticsearch &```
Check whether the elasticsearch instance is running by viewing `nohup.out`. Note that the cluster health will keep [yellow] during the entire process, because we are running only one elasticsearch node and none of the replica shards is initiated. For more information, check the [Shards & Replicas section] (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/_basic_concepts.html)
